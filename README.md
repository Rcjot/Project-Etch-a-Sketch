Hi! 

This is my Etch a Sketch!


first off i didnt know how to make a grid using flexbox, so i had to look it up..

had to do math so boxes are contained in the container!

ASFKJDPOFIJSK... i didnt know how removing elements work.. i learned how to make references to elements made in a function....

rainbows and buttons work now! 16:30;

i dont know how to make it so that box wouldn't be changed from rainbow color to black vicev esrsa
